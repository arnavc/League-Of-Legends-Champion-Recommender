# League of Legends Champion Recommender 

Capstone Project for Galvanize Data Science Immersive Program

# Introduction

League of Legends is the most played online PC videogame in the world with over 100 million players monthly according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2016/09/13/riot-games-reveals-league-of-legends-has-100-million-monthly-players/#1ad9ebb65aa8). The game is designed to be a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) which pits a team of five players versus another team of five players. Each player is able to control one champion of their choice throughout the entirety of the game and the goal is to destroy the other team's base. The game currently has 138 playable champions with many more planned for release. On average, a player never gets to play more than 20-30 champions despite playing the game for years and years. 

With so many potential champions to choose from, a problem that plagues novice and veteran players is: which champion that I haven't tried would I have fun playing? The goal of this project is to create a recommender system that can address said struggle by recommending champions that the user will enjoy.
